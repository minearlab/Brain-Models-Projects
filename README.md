# Brain-Models-Projects
This is a Unity repository for some of the brain model assets we've created for use in Unity projects. This project was supported by the APS Fund for Teaching and Public Understanding of Psychological Science, a University of Wyoming Libraries Alt-Textbook Grant, a UW A&S Seed Grant and NSF Grant #1660996. All three sets of models (Axial Slices, Coronal Slices and a model of the main subcortical structures) were segmented from the 7 Tesla MRI data set published by Edlow et al. (2019). If you are interested in printable OBJ files, we should have those available on the University of Wyoming Sketchfab account shortly. 
If you use these assets in a project leading to publication, please cite our manuscript 

Minear, M., Rodriguez-Carey, V., Gellis, B., Krosley, S. & Mitchell, K. The Creation of High-Resolution Brain Models for 3D Printing and Virtual Reality Applications. (under review)

We will be continuing to update this repo as we segment more structures as well as uploading Unity projects that use these assets to teach neuroanatomy.
